Milesone 1: A tribute to the Mighty Nein

This static frontend site is a tongue-in-cheek webpage for the fictional group "The Mighty Nein". Originally from the Dungeons and Dragons game under Geek and Sundry (https://geekandsundry.com/),
though now exclusively under Critical Role (https://critrole.com/) this fictional group of mercenaries (blades for hire) travel around the fictional world of Exandria, completing quests for coin.
This website exists under the pretense that the Mighty Nein are a real group available for hire, and, as such, provides some information about the members of the group, including links to character 
pages, as well as a contact form to enquire about hiring.

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features

There are 8 main components to this site;

1. Navigation bar - allows user to navigate to sections of the page directly, without scrolling.
2. Parallax image - create a visual impact upon entering the page
3. About section - this section gives users some overall information about the Mighty Nein, and why the user might want to hire them 
4. Character Carousel - this gives more specific information about each of the members of the Mighty Nein, including providing links to each character's wiki page
5. Video Link - allows the user to watch a short video displaying the Mighty Nein's skillsets
6. Contact form - allows the user to contact the Mighty Nein to enquire about hiring/ ask for clarification
7. Social media links - allows the user to find out more information about the Mighty Nein and follow them on various social media
8. Footer - Provides upcoming live dates and extra contact information


Features Left to Implement

I would like to create character sheets that users can download attached to the end of each character card within the carousel, rather than linking users to the character wiki (an external site).
I would also like to implement an interactive timeline/ record of Mighty Nein victories, so that users can get a feel of the group's achievements thus far.
I would like to reinstate the parallax scrolling effect, with separate layers, to create perspective and a feeling of adventure.

Technologies Used

1. Bootstrap - framework
2. JQuery - this project uses Jquery to both simplify the DOM manipulation, and originally to allow the active scrolling status of the character carousel, though this was later replaced by Flickity's framework. 
3. Popper.js - as above
4. Fontawesome - for social media symbols
5.
6. SCSS/SASS
7. Flickity (https://flickity.metafizzy.co/) - library/ framework - used for responsive carousel, with multi-cell display

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

Testing

HTML has been validated through --> https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input -->
CSS has been validated through --> https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input --> with no errors found

Cross-platform website functionality has been tested through --> https://www.responsinator.com/


In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
